I've been a full-stack application developer since 2019, working on end-to-end software solutions across various industries. My projects have ranged from simple websites to full-scale web applications, and I've covered the entire spectrum of full-stack development.

In addition to my work as a full-stack developer, I also have an interest in low-level programming, reverse engineering, and so-called "game hacking". For over half a decade, I have honed my skills to become an effective reverse engineer and cheat developer. I've written trainers, aimbots, fullblown ESPs, and various other types of "mods".
