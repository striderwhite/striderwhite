I'm a passionate full-stack Laravel developer with a love for creating web applications that combine the power of Laravel, Vue.js, and MySQL. 

I also have a deep interest in reverse engineering, as well as low-level programming with C++ and x86/x64 assembly.

I've been a full-stack application developer since 2019, working on end-to-end software solutions across various industries. My projects have ranged from simple websites to full-scale web applications, and I've covered the entire spectrum of full-stack development.

In addition to my work as a full-stack developer, I also have an interest in low-level programming, reverse engineering, and so-called "game hacking". For over half a decade, I have honed my skills to become an effective reverse engineer and cheat developer. 

I use disassemblers such as "IDA" to statically analyze binaries, as well as memory viewers/debuggers such as "Cheat Engine" and "Reclass" to reverse engineer software. Using information gained from this, I use a combination of techniques (such as hooking) to create "modifications" for the software, usually in the form of DLLs that are "injected" into a running process in order to gain access to its memory space. Using these techniques, I've written trainers, aimbots, ESPs, and various other types of "mods".
